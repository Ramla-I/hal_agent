# **32 Important security notice**


The STMicroelectronics group of companies (ST) places a high value on product security,
which is why the ST product(s) identified in this documentation may be certified by various
security certification bodies and/or may implement our own security measures as set forth
herein. However, no level of security certification and/or built-in security measures can
guarantee that ST products are resistant to all forms of attacks. As such, it is the
responsibility of each of ST's customers to determine if the level of security provided in an
ST product meets the customer needs both in relation to the ST product alone, as well as
when combined with other components and/or software for the customer end product or
application. In particular, take note that:


      - ST products may have been certified by one or more security certification bodies, such
as Platform Security Architecture (www.psacertified.org) and/or Security Evaluation
standard for IoT Platforms (www.trustcb.com). For details concerning whether the ST
product(s) referenced herein have received security certification along with the level
and current status of such certification, either visit the relevant certification standards
website or go to the relevant product page on _www.st.com_ for the most up to date
information. As the status and/or level of security certification for an ST product can
change from time to time, customers should re-check security certification status/level
as needed. If an ST product is not shown to be certified under a particular security
standard, customers should not assume it is certified.


      - Certification bodies have the right to evaluate, grant and revoke security certification in
relation to ST products. These certification bodies are therefore independently
responsible for granting or revoking security certification for an ST product, and ST
does not take any responsibility for mistakes, evaluations, assessments, testing, or
other activity carried out by the certification body with respect to any ST product.


      - Industry-based cryptographic algorithms (such as AES, DES, or MD5) and other open
standard technologies which may be used in conjunction with an ST product are based
on standards which were not developed by ST. ST does not take responsibility for any
flaws in such cryptographic algorithms or open technologies or for any methods which
have been or may be developed to bypass, decrypt or crack such algorithms or
technologies.


      - While robust security testing may be done, no level of certification can absolutely
guarantee protections against all attacks, including, for example, against advanced
attacks which have not been tested for, against new or unidentified forms of attack, or
against any form of attack when using an ST product outside of its specification or
intended use, or in conjunction with other components or software which are used by
customer to create their end product or application. ST is not responsible for resistance
against such attacks. As such, regardless of the incorporated security features and/or
any information or support that may be provided by ST, each customer is solely
responsible for determining if the level of attacks tested for meets their needs, both in
relation to the ST product alone and when incorporated into a customer end product or
application.


      - All security features of ST products (inclusive of any hardware, software,
documentation, and the like), including but not limited to any enhanced security
features added by ST, are provided on an "AS IS" BASIS. AS SUCH, TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ST DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, unless the
applicable written and signed contract terms specifically provide otherwise.
